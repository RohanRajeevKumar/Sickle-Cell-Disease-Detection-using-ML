# Sickle-Cell-Disease-Detection-using-ML
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin, leading to deformed, sickle- shaped red blood cells. Manual microscopic examination for diagnosis is laborious, time- consuming, and prone to subjectivity. This project explores the development and evaluation of an automated system for detecting and classifying red blood cells, specifically identifying sickle cells, from microscopic images using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Various approaches were investigated, including traditional machine learning methods based on feature extraction (K-Nearest Neighbors) and deep learning techniques utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including a custom CNN architecture and analysis related to the VGG16 model. The system aims to preprocess images, segment individual cells, classify them into categories (Circular, Sickle, Other), and provide visualizations and quantitative results, demonstrating the potential for automated, efficient, and objective SCD screening.
